  <h3>THE GREATER CHALLENGE</h3>

  <h4>Written by <a href="https://www.ncssm.edu/news/2017/10/11/from-three-generations-one-worthy-and-winning-alma-mater">The Martine Family</a></h4>

  <p>Alike in truths that we share</p>
  <p>To learn is to be alive</p>
  <p>What joy becoming aware</p>
  <p>Of a school where excellence thrives</p>
  <p>And so choosing and chosen we go</p>
  <p>To find and to explore</p>
  <p>The greater challenge of all that’s in store</p>

  <p>No laboratory so fine</p>
  <p>As testing ground we find here</p>
  <p>No union of heart and mind</p>
  <p>As friendships formed in these years</p>
  <p>As we’re into worlds yet unknown</p>
  <p>By vision clear and bright</p>
  <p>The greater challenge remains in our sight</p>

  <p>As long as ever we live</p>
  <p>Whatever mountains we climb</p>
  <p>Whatever we have to give</p>
  <p>Was honed within that brief time</p>
  <p>So may always our gratitude shine</p>
  <p>In what we do and say</p>
  <p>The greater challenge is ours every day.</p>
